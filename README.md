# This Repository's purpose is to show just some of Bryan Acosta's past assignments and coding projects to prove software skill. 

I am a proud first-generation third-year computational engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. I love deep space exploration, spacecraft, astronomy, and programming, but more than anything, I love serving my community. I have plenty of industry level software experience and am qualified for Software Engineering roles. I have experience with Fortran, Python, C++, MATLAB, JAVA, Linux, and more. Everything I do is so one day I can work my dream job in the space industry.

If you have any questions about me or my experience please feel free to rach out. My email is b.acosta@utexas.edu.
