# Pandemic Simulation

The purpose of this project is to generate a code that simulates a pandemic. It requests how big the population is, how contagious the population is, how many people are infected, and how many people dont social distance. Then, it shows how many days it takes for the disease to dissepate. The coolest part about it is seeing how fast or how slow the disease spreads.
